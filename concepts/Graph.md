Graph is probably the data structure that has the closest resemblance to our daily life. 
There are many types of graphs describing the relationships in real life. 
For instance, our friend circle is a huge “graph”.

In Figure 1 above, we can see that person G, B, and E are all direct friends of A, while person C, D, and F are indirect friends of A. This example is a social graph of friendship. So, what is the “graph” data structure?

# Types of “graphs”
There are many types of “graphs”. In this Explore Card, we will introduce three types of graphs: undirected graphs, directed graphs, and weighted graphs.

# Undirected graphs
The edges between any two vertices in an “undirected graph” do not have a direction, indicating a two-way relationship.

Figure 1 is an example of an undirected graph.

# Directed graphs
The edges between any two vertices in a “directed graph” graph are directional.

Figure 2 is an example of a directed graph.
